The standard polar code constructions are designed to minimize the FER of an SC decoder. However, there are polar decoders more powerful than SC, and for some applications BER is more important than FER. We ask, can the code construction be tweaked to minimize the BER of a CRC-aided list decoder? This paper reports an initial investigation of this question. Simulation results show that when communicating through a binary AWGN channel, it sometimes helps to use a code constructed for a noisier binary AWGN channel.},

To reduce the engineering costs and the time-to-market of platforms with new computing devices, the processor customization process should be supported with automated design flows that include tools like retargeting compilers, instruction-set simulators, and RTL generators. This chapter presents an open source processor co-design toolset that is based on a computation resource oriented design methodology where the primary design choices are the set of resources to include in the processor at hand, instead of focusing on instruction encoding details. The toolset is based on a retargetable high-level language compiler and a scalable exposed datapath template which support different styles of parallelism available in applications. In addition to various published academic processor design examples for SDR algorithms, the tools have been used to design and program processors that have been implemented down to silicon layout level and integrated in commercial grade chips.},

	abstract = {A popular way to exploit high level programming languages in FPGA designs is to use a soft-core with accompanying software development tools. However, a common shortcoming with the current soft-core offerings is their limited software execution capability: the required performance for the implementation can be often reached only with instruction set extensions. In this paper, we propose and evaluate an application-specific processor design toolset that uses a multi-issue exposed data path processor architecture template. The main benefit of the architecture is scalability with respect to instruction-level parallelism (ILP). The design flow allows the designer to freely customize the data path resources in the core to exploit the ILP available in computation intensive kernels. The design toolset includes a retargetable C compiler and an architecture simulator, making design space exploration feasible. The experiments show that a relatively small soft-core tailored with the toolset provides significant speedups on software execution without using any instruction set extensions. The best measured speedup in comparison to the major commercial soft-cores was fourfold in applications from the CHStone benchmark suite, while the amount of consumed FPGA resources remained moderate.},

In this paper, the first hardware decoder architecture implementing the Soft-output CANcellation (SCAN) decoding algorithm, is presented.

The SCAN decoder architecture is compared to another soft-output decoder that implements a Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm. The SCAN decoder can reach a higher throughput than a BP decoder, with a lower memory footprint. Moreover, only one iteration with the SCAN algorithm leads to better decoding performance than 50 iterations of the BP algorithm.},

	doi = {10.1109/SiPS.2015.7344984},
	abstract = {Polar codes are newly discovered capacity-achieving codes, which have attracted lots of research efforts. Polar codes can be efficiently decoded by the low-complexity successive cancelation (SC) algorithm and the SC list (SCL) decoding algorithm. The belief propagation (BP) decoding algorithm not only is an alternative to the SC and SCL decoders, but also provides soft outputs that are necessary for joint detection and decoding. Both the BP decoder and the soft cancelation (SCAN) decoder were proposed for polar codes to output soft information about the coded bits. In this paper, first a belief propagation decoding algorithm, called reduced complexity soft cancelation (RCSC) decoding algorithm, is proposed. Let N denote the block length. Our RCSC decoding algorithm needs to store only 5N - 3 log-likelihood ratios (LLRs), significantly less than 4N - 2+ N log2N/2 and N(log2 N +1) LLRs needed by the BP and SCAN decoders, respectively, when N ≥ 64. Besides, compared to the SCAN decoding algorithm, our RCSC decoding algorithm eliminates unnecessary additions over the real field. Then the simplified SC (SSC) principle is applied to our RCSC decoding algorithm, and the resulting SSC-aided RCSC (S-RCSC) decoding algorithm further reduces the computational complexity. Finally, based on the S-RCSC decoding algorithm, we propose a corresponding memory efficient decoder architecture, which has better error performance than existing architectures. Besides, our decoder architecture consumes less energy on updating LLRs.},

We show that both BCH-polar and Conv-polar codes can have a frame error rate that decays exponentially with the code length for all rates up to capacity, which is a substantial improvement in the error exponent over stand-alone polar codes. Interleaved concatenation with long constraint length convolutional codes is an effective way to leverage the fact that polarization increases the cutoff rate of the channel. Simulation results show that Conv-polar codes when decoded with the proposed soft-output multistage iterative decoding algorithm can outperform stand-alone polar codes decoded with successive cancellation or belief propagation decoding. It may be comparable to stand-alone polar codes with list decoding in the high SNR regime. In addition to this, we show that the proposed concatenation scheme requires lower memory and decoding complexity in comparison to belief propagation and list decoding of polar codes. Practically, the scheme enables rate compatible outer codes which ease hardware implementation. Our results suggest that the proposed method may strike a better balance between performance and complexity compared to existing methods in the finite-length regime.},

However, due to the high computational requirements, its software-defined implementation is challenging. This paper proposes a static multi-issue exposed datapath processor design tailored for turbo decoding. In order to utilize the parallel processor datapath efficiently without resorting to low level assembly programming, the turbo decoder is implemented using OpenCL, a parallel programming standard for heterogeneous devices. The proposed implementation includes only a small set of Turbo-specific custom operations to accelerate the most critical parts of the algorithm. Most of the computation is performed using general-purpose integer operations. Thus, the processor design can be used as a general-purpose OpenCL accelerator for arbitrary integer workloads as well. The proposed processor design was evaluated both by implementing it using a Xilinx Virtex 6 FPGA and by ASIC synthesis using 130 nm and 40 nm technology libraries. The implementation achieves over 63 Mbps Turbo decoding throughput on a single low-power core.

On the other hand, faster time-to-market motivates the investigation of programmable implementations. This paper presents a novel design of a programmable turbo decoder as an application-specific instruction-set processor (ASIP) using transport triggered architecture (TTA). The processor architecture is designed in such a manner that it can be programmed with high level language to support different suboptimal maximum a posteriori (MAP) algorithms in a single TTA processor. The design enables the designer to change the algorithms according to the frame error rate performance requirement. A quadratic polynomial permutation interleaver is used for contention-free memory access and to make the processor 3GPP LTE compliant. Several optimization techniques to enable real time processing on programmable platforms are introduced. The essential parts of the turbo decoding algorithm are designed with vector function units. Unlike most other turbo decoder ASIPs, high level language is used to program the processor to meet the time-to-market requirements. With a single iteration, 68.35 Mbps decoding speed is achieved for the max-log-MAP algorithm at a clock frequency of 210 MHz on 90 nm technology.},

As processors are becoming increasingly powerful and energy efficient, there is now a strong desire to perform this processing in software to reduce production costs and time to market. The recently introduced family of Successive Cancellation decoders for Polar codes has been shown in several research works to efficiently leverage the ubiquitous SIMD units in modern CPUs, while offering strong potentials for a wide range of optimizations. The P-EDGE environment introduced in this paper, combines a specialized skeleton generator and a building blocks library routines to provide a generic, extensible Polar code exploration workbench. It enables ECC code designers to easily experiments with combinations of existing and new optimizations, while delivering performance close to state-of-art decoders.},

We observe that our solution signiﬁcantly reduces the construction complexity as compared to state-of-the-art solutions while providing a block error rate performance comparable to constructions that are highly optimized for speciﬁc lengths and rates. This makes the constructed polar codes highly suitable for practical application in future communication systems requiring a large set of polar codes with different lengths and rates.},

In this paper, unified descriptions of the SC, SCL, and SCS decoding algorithms are given as path search procedures on the code tree of polar codes. Combining the principles of SCL and SCS, a new decoding algorithm called the successive cancellation hybrid (SCH) is proposed. This proposed algorithm can provide a flexible configuration when the time and space complexities are limited. Furthermore, a pruning technique is also proposed to lower the complexity by reducing unnecessary path searching operations. Performance and complexity analysis based on simulations shows that under proper configurations, all the three improved successive cancellation (ISC) decoding algorithms can approach the performance of the maximum likelihood (ML) decoding but with acceptable complexity. With the help of the proposed pruning technique, the time and space complexities of ISC decoders can be significantly reduced and be made very close to those of the SC decoder in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime.},

For that reason it is important to have efficient implementation architectures for polar codes in hardware. Motivated by this fact we propose a belief propagation (BP) decoder architecture for an increasingly popular hardware platform; Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The proposed architecture supports any code rate and is quite flexible in terms of hardware complexity and throughput. The architecture can also be extended to support multiple block lengths without increasing the hardware complexity a lot. Moreover various schedulers can be adapted into the proposed architecture so that list decoding techniques can be used with a single block. Finally the proposed architecture is compared with a convolutional turbo code (CTC) decoder for WiMAX taken from a Xilinx Product Specification and seen that polar codes are superior to CTC codes both in hardware complexity and throughput.},

Unlike SC and SC-List decoding algorithms, the SCAN decoding algorithm provides soft outputs (useful for, e.g., parallel concatenated decoders Zhang et al. IEEE Trans Commun 64(2):456–466 2016). Despite the strong data dependencies in the SCAN decoding, two highly parallel software implementations are devised for x86 processor target. Different parallelization strategies, algorithmic improvements, and source code optimizations were applied in order to enhance the throughput of the decoders. The impact of the parallelization approach, the code rate, and the code length on the throughput and the latency is investigated. Extensive experimentations demonstrate that the proposed software polar decoder can exceed 600 Mb/s on a single core and reaches multi-Gb/s when using four cores simultaneously. These decoders can then achieve real-time performance required in many applications such as software defined radio or cloud-RAN systems where network physical layer is implemented in software.},

	abstract = {Recently, Ar\{{\textbackslash}i\}kan introduced the method of channel polarization on which one can construct efficient capacity-achieving codes, called polar codes, for any binary discrete memoryless channel. In the thesis, we show that decoding algorithm of polar codes, called successive cancellation decoding, can be regarded as belief propagation decoding, which has been used for decoding of low-density parity-check codes, on a tree graph. On the basis of the observation, we show an efficient construction method of polar codes using density evolution, which has been used for evaluation of the error probability of belief propagation decoding on a tree graph. We further show that channel polarization phenomenon and polar codes can be generalized to non-binary discrete memoryless channels. Asymptotic performances of non-binary polar codes, which use non-binary matrices called the Reed-Solomon matrices, are better than asymptotic performances of the best explicitly known binary polar code. We also find that the Reed-Solomon matrices are considered to be natural generalization of the original binary channel polarization introduced by Ar\{{\textbackslash}i\}kan.},

	abstract = {In this paper, polar codes are first applied in non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and the channel polarization idea is extended to NOMA, which is a major multiple access technique in 5G systems. The polar coded NOMA (PC-NOMA) scheme is proposed, whereby the NOMA channel is decomposed into a series of binary-input channels under a two-stage channel polarization transform. In the first stage, the NOMA channel is divided into a group of user synthesized channels by using the multi-level coding structure. In the second stage, based on the structure of bit-interleaved code modulation, user synthesized channels are further decomposed into binary polarized channels. Then, a joint successive cancellation decoding scheme is given to construct the multiuser receiver of PC-NOMA. Finally, a low complexity search algorithm is proposed to schedule the NOMA decoding order which improves the error performance by enhanced polarization among user synthesized channels. The block error ratio performances over additive white Gaussian noise channels indicate that the proposed PC-NOMA obviously outperforms the turbo coded NOMA scheme due to the advantages of the two-stage polarization.},

C-RAN enables energy efficient network operation and possible cost savings on baseband resources. Furthermore, it improves network capacity by performing load balancing and cooperative processing of signals originating from several base stations.
